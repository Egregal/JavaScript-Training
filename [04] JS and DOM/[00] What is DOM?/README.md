# The HTML DOM

- DOM Stands for **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel
- The browser creates a DOM of the page when a webpage is first loaded
- It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
- The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of **Objects**:

With the help of DOM, JS can be used to create dynamic HTML.

- Javascript can:
    - change all the HTML elements, attributes and CSS styles in the page
    - remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    - add new HTML elements and attributes
    - react to all existing HTML events in the page
    - create new HTML events in the page

**Bottom line: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, delete or react to events of the HTML elements.**
